# Machine Learning Model Evaluation

## What is Covered
In this repository, we'll explore techniques for evaluating machine learning models. Our focus will be on Supervised Learning Models. Here is excatly what will be covered:

1. **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Regression Metrics, The Confusion Matrix, Classification Metrics
2. **Bias Viariance Analysis:** Learning Curves, Loss Curves, Validation Curves, Adjusting for Bias/Variance
3. **Error Analysis:** How to analyse model errors, discretisation & calibration for error analysis

## Practical Examples
We'll culminate the notes by going through end-to-end machine learning workflows:

1. Image Classification
2. Text Classification
3. Regression

## Background Knowledge
These notes assume and require an adept understand of the following:
1. Data preparation techniques for machine learning i.e. cleaning and preprocessing
2. An understanding of supervised machine learning algorithms and how to build ML models
