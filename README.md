# Machine Learning Model Evaluation
In this repository, we'll explore techniques for evaluating machine learning models. Our focus will be on Supervised Learning Models.

## Background Knowledge
These notes assume and require an adept understand of the following:
1. Data preparation techniques for machine learning i.e. cleaning and preprocessing
2. An understanding of supervised machine learning algorithms and how to build ML models i.e. Regression and Classification
3. Some understanding of neural networks is great but not necessarily required for these notes

## What is Covered
Here is excatly what will be covered:

1. **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Cross-Validatiopn Review, Regression Metrics, The Classification Metrics & the Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve & PR Curve
2. **Bias Viariance Analysis:** Bias-Variance Trade-Off Review, Learning Curves, Validation Curves, Loss Curves, Strategies to optimise models after diagnosing performance
3. **Error Analysis & Baselines:** Systematic Error Analysis, Baseline/Dummy Models for Sanity Check, Encode the full ML Workflow
4. **Advanced Evaluation Considerations:** Class Imbalanaces, Calibration of Probablistic Models, Interpreting/Visualising Model Results
5. **End-to-end ML Project:** Here is we'll go through an end-to-end image classification project incorporating all the steps of data preparation, modeling, and most importantly the model evaluation techniques covered here
